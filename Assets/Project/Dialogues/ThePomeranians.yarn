Toto: Hey, Fluffy, hey Puffy! Have you seen my parent this morning?
Fluffy: Hey Toto, no, we haven't.
Puffy: Not this morning.
Toto: That's bizarreâ€¦
Toto: By the way, why aren't your parents with you?
Fluffy: We don't care as long as we're still NO.1 in the sniffing butt game!
Puffy: Stupid humans always get in our way! It's better without them!
